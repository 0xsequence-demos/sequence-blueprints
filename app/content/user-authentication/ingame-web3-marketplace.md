## Let users build a live economy in your game!

Ingame orders are the perfect way for your community to build an economy seamlessly into your game. 
The API is simple, powerful, and you're not limited in the design. 

Also, orders are asyncronous, meaning you don't need to interact with your trading partners in real-time. Just set up your orders and see if anyone bites.
